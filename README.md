# vscodSettings
visual studio code settings (.vscode)

put .vscode directory to your working directory.

since trying to use msvc on vscode was little tricky,
and the official setting did not work for me, so
I upload my setting as my note.


### problem
clang (install with visual studio) can be compiled but can't be debugged with this setting.
If any body know how to debug with clang, please lmk.


#### point with setting

use vccars64.bat for x64
